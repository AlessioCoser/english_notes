# Reflexive pronouns

[Resource](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/english-grammar-reference/reflexive-pronouns)

## The reflexive pronouns are

**singular** | myself     | yourself    |	himself, herself, itself |
**plural**   | ourselves 	| yourselves 	| themselves               |

## 1. As direct object

We use a reflexive pronoun as a **direct object** when** the object** is the same as the subject of the verb

We can use it with most transitive verbs, but these are the most common:

amuse | blame     | cut  | dry     | enjoy   | help  |
hurt  | introduce | kill | prepare | satisfy | teach |

### EXAMPLES:

- I am teaching **myself** to play the piano.
- Be careful with that knife. You might cut **yourself**.

### BE CAREFUL:

We **do not use** a reflexive pronoun after verbs which **describe things people usually do for themselves**

- He **washed** in cold water.
- He always **shaved** before going out in the evening.
- Michael **dressed** and got ready for the party.

We **only use** reflexives with these verbs for **emphasis**

- He dressed himself in spite of his injuries.
- She’s old enough to wash herself.

## 2. As indirect object

We use reflexive pronouns as an **indirect object** when the **indirect object** is the same as the subject of the verb

### EXAMPLES:

- Would **you** like to pour **yourself** a drink?
- **We**’ve brought **ourselves** something to eat.

## 3. As object of preposition

We use reflexive pronouns as **the object of a preposition** when the **object** is the same as the subject of the verb

### EXAMPLES:

- **They** had to cook for **themselves**.
- **He** was feeling very sorry for **himself**.

### BE CAREFUL:

We use **object pronouns**, _not reflexives_, after prepositions of place:

- He had a suitcase beside **him**. _(NOT himself)_

and after **with** when it means **accompanied by**:

- She had a few friends with **her**. _(NOT herself)_

## 3a. As object of preposition 'by'

To show that someone did something without any help:

- The children got dressed **by themselves**.
- I prepared the whole meal **by myself**.

To show that someone was alone:

- He lived **by himself** in an enormous house.
- She walked home **by herself**.

## 4. To emphasise the person or thing we are referring to

We use reflexive pronouns to emphasise the person or thing we are referring to. Especially if we are talking about someone very famous:

- **Kendal itself** is quite a small town.
- **Sir Paul McCartney himself** sang the final song.

We often put the reflexive pronoun **at the end of the clause** when we are using it for **emphasis**:

- I baked the bread **myself**.
- She mended the car **herself**.

## + Change of meaning

Some verbs change their meaning slightly when they have a reflexive pronoun as direct object:

| Would you like to **help yourself** to another drink?      | _Would you like to **take** another drink?_                                         |
| I wish the children would **behave themselves**.           | _I wish the children would **behave well**._                                        |
| He **found himself** lying by the side of the road.        | _He **was surprised when he realised that he was** lying by the side of the road._  |
| I saw myself as a famous actor.                            | _I **imagined that I was** a famous actor._                                         |
| She **applied herself** to the job of mending the lights.  | _She **worked very hard** to mend the lights._                                      |
| He **busied himself** in the kitchen.                      | _He **worked busily** in the kitchen._                                              |
| I had to **content myself** with a few euros.              | _I had to **be satisfied** with a few euros._                                       |
