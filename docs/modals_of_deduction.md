# Modals of deduction

## Talking about the present

| **must**                        | when we feel sure that something is true or it's the only realistic possibility. |
| **can't**                       | when we feel sure that something is not possible.                                |
| **might**, **may** or **could** | to say that we think something is possible but we're not sure.                   |
| **might not**, **may not**      | to say that we think something is unlikely but we're not sure.                   |

_may is **more formal** than might and could._
