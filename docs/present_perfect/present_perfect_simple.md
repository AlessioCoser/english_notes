# Present perfect simple

- [Resource](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/present-perfect-use.html)

## 1. How long
We use this tense when we want to talk about _unfinished actions_ or _states_ or _habits_ that **started in the past and continue to the present**.

This use is very similar to how we use the [present perfect simple with How long](./present_perfect_continuous.html#1-how-long). Often it's possible to use either tense.

Usually we use it to say **how long** and we need **since** or **for**. We often use stative verbs.

- I **have known** Karen since 1994.
- She **is lived** in London for three years.
- I **'ve worked** here for six months.

**NB:** We often use this with [since and for](./present_perfect.html#since-and-for)

---

## 2. Life experience

These are actions or events that happened sometime during a person's life.

We don't say when the experience happened, and the person needs to be alive now. We often use the words **ever** and **never** here.

- I **have been** to Tokyo.
- They **have visited** Paris three times.
- We **have** never **seen** that film.

---

## 3. Unfinished time word

Like this month, this week, today. The period of time is still continuing.

- I **haven't seen** her this month.
- She **has drunk** three cups of coffee today.
- I **have already** moved house twice this year!

We **can't** use the present perfect with a finished time word.

**NOT:** ~~I've seen him yesterday.~~

## 4. Unfinished with Present result

With a focus on result. _(for finished actions use [present perfect continuous](./present_perfect_continuous.html#3-finished-with-present-result) instead)_

We often use the present perfect to talk about something that happened in the recent past, but that is still true or important now.

**Sometimes we can use the past simple here, especially in US English.**

- I **have lost** my keys (so I can't get into my house).
- She **has hurt** her leg (so she can't play tennis today).
- They **have missed** the bus (so they will be late).

---

## 5: News and recent events

We can also use the present perfect to talk about something that happened recently, even if there isn't a clear result in the present.

This is common when we want to introduce news and we often use the words **just** / **yet** / **already** / **recently**.

**However, the past simple is also correct in these cases, especially in US English.**

- I **have just** seen Lucy. _(I just saw Lucy)_
- The Queen **has given** a speech.
- The Mayor **has announced** a new plan for the railways.

# Since and for

## Since

We use **since** with a fixed time in the past (2004, April 23rd, last year).

The fixed time can be another action, which is in the past simple (since I was at school, since I arrived).

- I've known Sam **since** 1992.
- I've liked chocolate **since** I was a child.
- She's been here **since** 2pm.

## For

We use **for** with a period of time (2 hours, three years, six months).

- I've known Julie **for** ten years.
- I've been hungry **for** hours.
- She's had a cold **for** a week.

# Been and gone

In this tense, we use both **been** and **gone** as the past participle of **go**, but in slightly different circumstances.

## Been

We use **been** (often when we talk about life experience) to mean that the person we're talking about **visited the place and came back**.

- I've **been** to Paris (in my life, but now I'm in London, where I live).
- She has **been** to school today (but now she's back at home).
- They have never **been** to California.

## Gone

We use **gone** (often when we are talking about an action with a result in the present) to mean that the person **went to the place and is at the place now**.

- Where's John? He's **gone** to the shops (he's at the shops now).
- Julie has **gone** to Mexico (now she's in Mexico).
- They've **gone** to Japan for three weeks (now they're in Japan).
