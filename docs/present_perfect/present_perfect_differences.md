# Differences between Present perfect simple and continuous

- [Resource](https://learnenglish.britishcouncil.org/grammar/intermediate-to-upper-intermediate/present-perfect-simple-and-continuous)

The present perfect **simple** usually focuses on the **result of the activity** in some way, and the present perfect **continuous** usually focuses on the **activity itself** in some way.

With present perfect **coninuous** you can't use **stative verbs**
