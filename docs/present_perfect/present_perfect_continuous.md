# Present perfect continuous

- [Resource](https://www.perfect-english-grammar.com/present-perfect-continuous-use.html)

## 1. How long
We use this tense when we want to talk about _unfinished actions_ that **started in the past and continue to the present**.

This use is very similar to how we use the [present perfect simple with How long](./present_perfect_simple.html#1-how-long). Often it's possible to use either tense.

- I **have been living** in London for two years.
- She **has been working** here since 2004.
- We **have been waiting** for the bus for hours.

**NB:** We often use this with [since and for](./present_perfect.html#since-and-for)

**With stative verbs, we can't use the present perfect continuous.**

- I've been here for hours.
- **NOT:** ~~I've been being here for hours.~~

## 2. Temporary habits or situations.

The action started in the past and continues to the present in the same way as with [1. How Long](./present_perfect_continuous.html#1-how-long), but we don't answer the questions about **how long** so clearly.

Instead, we use a word like **recently**.

- I **have been going** to the gym a lot recently.
- They **have been living** with his mother while they look for a house.
- I **have been reading** a lot recently.

This is very similar to the use of the [present continuous for temporary habits](./present_perfect_simple.html#1-how-long) and often either tense is possible.

## 3. Finished with present result

Actions which have recently stopped (though the whole action can be unfinished) and have a result, which we can often see, hear, or feel, in the present.

For unfinished actions use [present perfect simpe](./present_perfect_simple.html#4-unfinished-with-present-result) instead

We don't use a time word here.

- I'm so tired, I **have been studying**.
- I **have been running**, so I'm really hot.
- It **has been raining** so the pavement is wet.
