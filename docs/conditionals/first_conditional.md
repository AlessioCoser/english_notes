# First Conditional

**Possible and likely things in the future**

It's used to talk about things which might happen in the future. Of course, we can't know what will happen in the future, but this describes possible things, which could easily come true.

## Structure

if |	present simple + `,` | will | infinitive |

## Examples:

- If it rains, I won't go to the park.
- If I study today, I wll go to the party tonight.
- If I have enough money, I'll buy some new shoes.
- She'll be late if the train is delayed.
- She'll miss the bus if she doesn't leave soon.
- If I see her, I'll tell her.
