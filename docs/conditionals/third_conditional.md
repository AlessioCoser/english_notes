# Third Conditional

**Things that didn't happen in the past and their imaginary results**

It talks about the past. It's used to describe a situation that didn't happen, and to imagine the result of this situation.

## Structure

if |	past perfect + `,` | would | have | past participle |

## Examples:

-  If she **had studied**, she **would have passed** the exam (but, really we know she didn't study and so she didn't pass)
-  If I **hadn't eaten** so much, I **wouldn't have felt** sick (but I did eat a lot, and so I did feel sick).
-  If we **had taken** a taxi, we **wouldn't have missed** the plane
-  She **wouldn't have been** tired if she **had gone** to bed earlier
-  She **would have become** a teacher if she **had gone** to university
-  He **would have been** on time for the interview if he **had left** the house at nine
