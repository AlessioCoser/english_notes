# Second conditional

1. **Impossible things in the present**:
  - Talk about something in the present which is impossible, because it's not true. Is that clear?
2. **Unlikely things in the future**:
  - Talk about things in the future that are probably not going to be true. Maybe I'm imagining some dream for example.

**NB** We can use _were_ instead of _was_ with _I_ and _he/she/it_. This is mostly done in formal writing.

## Structure

if |	past simple + `,` | would | infinitive |

## Examples:

1. **Impossible things in the present**
  - If I were you, I wouldn't go out with that man.
  - If I had his number, I would call him. (I don't have his number now, so it's impossible for me to call him).

2. **Unlikely things in the future**
  - If I won the lottery, I would buy a big house.(I probably won't win the lottery)
  - If I met the Queen of England, I would say hello.
  - She would travel all over the world if she were rich.
  - She would pass the exam if she ever studied.(She never studies, so this won't happen)
