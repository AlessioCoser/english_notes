# Zero Conditional

**General truth and general habits**

This conditional is used when the result will always happen. I'm talking in general, not about one particular situation.
The _if_ in this conditional can usually be replaced by _when_ without changing the meaning.


### Structure

if |	present simple + `,` | present simple |

### Examples:

- If you add two and two, you get four
- If people eat too much, they get fat.
- If you touch a fire, you get burned.
- People die if they don't eat.
- You get water if you mix hydrogen and oxygen.
- Snakes bite if they are scared
- If babies are hungry, they cry
